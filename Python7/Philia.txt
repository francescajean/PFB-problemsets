Philia by Shel Silverstein

Philia loves me,
Philia cares,
Philia picks me peaches and pears.
Philia offers me candy and Cokes,
Philia listens and laughs at me jokes.
Philia helps when I get in a fight,
Philia does all my homework at night.
Philia misses me,
Philia cries,
Philia thinks I'm a wonderful guy.
So if you ask me who's my best friend, in a whiz,
I'll stand up and tell you that Philia is.
But yesterday night I got quite a scare,
I woke up and Philia just wasn't there.
I called out and reached out for Philia's hand,
In the darkness where Philia usually stands.
Then I poked through the house, in each cranny and nook,
But I found somebody each place that I looked.
I searched till I'm tired, and now with the dawn,
There's no doubt about it-
Philia's gone!
